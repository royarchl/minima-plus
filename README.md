# Minima+
Just a simple theme for making Discord a bit cleaner (for my liking).

> BetterFormattingRedux, BetterNsfwTag, DashToSpaceInChannelName, DateViewer, GameActivityToggle, HideEmbedLink, 
  PinDMs, QuickMuteChannels, ReadAllNotificationsButton, SpotifyControls, SupressReplyMentions (just QoL tbh), 
  TypingIndicator, and WhoReacted

#### MacOS Users
You do **NOT** need to enable transparency because that is for rounded corners. Instead, edit the theme file in the `theme` portion of the BetterDiscord settings and remove the lines labelled under **Rounded Corners**.

#### Installation
- [ ] Download the theme
- [ ] Enable transparency in the BetterDiscord settings (Windows users only)
- [ ] Restart Discord
- [ ] Enable the Minima+ theme
